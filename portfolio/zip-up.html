            <h2>Gray Cable Knit Zip-up</h2>

           <p>This cable knit sweater has become a staple in my wardrobe. It is simple but still very interesting. I used a medium weight acrylic yarn with size 7 needles.</p> 

           <p>This was my first time making a hood for a sweater. It took me a few tries to make something I was happy with. I took measurements from an existing hoodie I had to see how big to make the hood. However, once as I made the hood and sewed it onto the sweater, it was too heavy and made the sweater droop down. I ended up remaking it to be much smaller. It still fits fine and it was able to get rid of enough extra weight that it solved the drooping problem.</p> 
            
           <p>It was also my first time sewing a zipper onto a knitted garment. When I've put zippers onto items that I've sewn, I've always used my sewing machine. However, I was nervous to put my knitted sweater through my sewing machine, so I had to hand stitch it in. I tried to “stitch in the ditch” or sew in the lowest parts of the knit stitches to hide the thread as much as possible.</p>
