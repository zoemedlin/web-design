           <p>I was inspired by Taylor Swift's “folklore” sweater that she sold, so I made my own version with a fun twist! The original sweater is an off-white with black accents, but I decided to make mine lilac with navy blue accents. Purple is one of my favorite colors, so I figured this would be fun color for a sweater.</p> 

           <p>It took a very long time to make the pattern for this sweater. I tried to make my as close to the original as possible, but it's not exact. I was using a medium weight yarn, Caron's One Pound yarn, which meant my stitches were slightly larger than in the original. I had to slightly alter the design by leaving off some of the moss stitches in-between the cables. If I hadn't done this, then the sweater would have been too large for me.</p> 
            
           <p>I also learned how to do a new cable stitch for this project. On the center back there is a large diamond cable with moss stitches in the center. After doing some research and finding this helpful article, I realized how easy this cable is.</p>
