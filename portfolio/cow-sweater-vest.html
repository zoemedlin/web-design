            <h2>"Mooooo" Cow Sweater Vest</h2>

           <p>This sweater vest was inspired by my intense love of cows. I wanted to make something fun and playful that would express my personality. This was the first sweater vest I've made so it was fun to try something different.</p>

           <p>One thing I struggled with while making the pattern is figuring out where to start the arm holes. I knew that I wanted the cows to be near the top of the vest, but the position they were in meant that I couldn't make the arm hole as thin as I wanted without cutting into the cow design. In the future when I make more sweater vests I will have to be more mindful of the placement of the designs.</p>
